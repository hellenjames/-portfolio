          My adventure in coding begun with me having interest of wanting to
          know more about programming. Interesting part  was my push up guide that
          motivated me to like coding and made me to begin my journey of being a
          fullstack developer.
          </p>
          <p>
          Bit by bit i improved my skills from Html &
          Css,Javascript,React,Python for the backend,React Native and WordPress
          are the technologies that i can use in doing projects and
          programming.
          </p>
          <p>
          For some challenges that i face while coding is getting
          errors which may sometimes make a person to get stack but to some point
          helps me to do more of research and get assistance from other
          developers which another way of me learning. My future plans is being
          able to an instructor to other people who may want to know and learn
          coding.
